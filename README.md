### ðŸš€ I keep my best works under [<ins>this</ins>](https://github.com/BitzArt) organization.

- #### âš¡ [OCPI.Net](https://github.com/BitzArt/OCPI.Net) is an implementation of OCPI for .Net.

    OCPI (Open Charge Point Interface) is a protocol that allows distinct parties in the field of electric vehicle charging to communicate, exchange data and share functionality. More info [<ins>here</ins>](https://github.com/ocpi/ocpi).

- #### ðŸ¦¾ [ApiExceptions](https://github.com/BitzArt/ApiExceptions) is a nuget package with a mission to reinvent exceptions in C#.

  It provides additional exception classes and advanced functionality around handling errors.

- #### ðŸ“š [Pagination](https://github.com/BitzArt/Pagination) is a lightweight nuget package that provides pagination capabilities.
